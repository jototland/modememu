Step 1: Install com0com serial driver (or something equivalent)
        Signed version at: https://code.google.com/archive/p/powersdr-iq/downloads
        (Official version is at http://com0com.sourceforge.net/, but you really want the signed one)
        curl -o setup_com0com_W7_x64_signed.exe https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/powersdr-iq/setup_com0com_W7_x64_signed.exe
        Configure at least one serial port pair (recommended: COM3/COM4)

Step 2: Move to the directory containing this file

Step 3: Upgrade with git, or run the following commands in powershell to get the latest version:
        curl -o modememu.zip https://github.com/jototland/modememu/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
        Expand-Archive -Path .\modememu.zip -DestinationPath . -Verbose
        mv -Force modememu-main\*.* .
        rmdir -Recurse modememu-main

Step 4: Install embedded python and dependencies in subdirectory
        curl -o python-3.10.5-embed-amd64.zip https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.5/python-3.10.5-embed-amd64.zip
        rm -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Recurse .\emb_py
        Expand-Archive -Path .\python-3.10.5-embed-amd64.zip -DestinationPath .\emb_py -Verbose
        curl -o get-pip.py https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
        .\emb_py\python.exe .\get-pip.py
        rm .\emb_py\*._pth
        rm get-pip.py
        .\emb_py\python.exe -mpip install -r requirements.txt

Step 5: configure phonelog.json
        Look at phonelog-example.json for details.

Step 6: configure serial.json
        The COM port you set here is the one the modem emulator uses.
        The other COM port will be used by whatever program you are using
        Make sure the baudrate is set to the same as whatever program you are using.
        The other settings: bytesize and stopbits should probably not be touched.

Step 7: Test run
        Make sure to set whatever program you are using to use the COM port not used by the modem
        .\emb_py\python main.py
        End with Ctrl+Break (Ctrl+C doesn't work)

Step 8: Install as a service with WinSW
        curl  -o modem-service.exe https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases/download/v2.11.0/WinSW-x64.exe
        .\modem-service.exe install

Step 9: start service in windows

Step 10: Test again

Step âˆž: Uninstall service
            set-service -name modem-service -startuptype manual
            stop-service modem-service
            .\modem-service.exe uninstall
